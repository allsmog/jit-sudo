Description: Just-In-Time sudo access with approval workflows
 JIT Sudo provides time-limited, auditable sudo access through intelligent
 approval workflows. It replaces permanent sudo privileges with temporary,
 cryptographically-verified grants that automatically expire.
 .
 Key features:
  * Time-limited sudo access (TTL-based expiration)
  * Smart risk-based approval system
  * Auto-approval for safe commands, admin approval for sensitive operations
  * Complete audit trails for compliance (SOX/PCI/HIPAA)
  * Enterprise integration (Slack, email, OIDC/SAML)
  * Encrypted storage with AES-256-GCM
  * Production-ready security hardening
 .
 This package includes:
  * jitctl - Command-line interface for users and admins
  * jitd - Background daemon for grant management
  * jit_approval.so - Sudo plugin for access validation
  * Configuration files and systemd service
