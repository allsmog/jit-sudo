# JIT Sudo Security Audit Report

**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Auditor**: Security Analysis System  
**System**: JIT Sudo - Just-In-Time Sudo Access System  
**Version**: Current main branch (commit d11fe52)  

## Executive Summary

The JIT Sudo system demonstrates **excellent architectural design** for implementing time-limited privilege escalation, but contains **critical security vulnerabilities** that make it unsuitable for production deployment without remediation. While the core concept and many implementation details are sound, hardcoded cryptographic secrets and incomplete security features present significant risks.

**Overall Security Rating: üî¥ 4/10 - NOT PRODUCTION READY**

## üö® Critical Vulnerabilities (Must Fix)

### 1. Hardcoded JWT Signing Key (CVSS 9.8)
**Location**: `libjit-sudo/src/grant.rs:59` and `jitctl/src/commands/request.rs:104`
```rust
let key = DecodingKey::from_secret(b"dev-secret-key");
```
**Impact**: 
- Any attacker with source code access can forge JWTs
- Complete authentication bypass possible
- No protection against privilege escalation

**Recommendation**: Implement proper cryptographic key management with:
- RSA/ECDSA key pairs with 256-bit minimum
- JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint integration  
- Hardware Security Module (HSM) or TPM key storage
- Key rotation capabilities

### 2. Mock Authentication Bypass (CVSS 8.5)
**Location**: `jitctl/src/commands/request.rs:62-104`
```rust
fn create_mock_token(cmd: &str, runas: &str, ttl: &str) -> Result<String> {
    // Create a mock JWT for development
    // In production, this would come from the broker
```
**Impact**:
- Users can grant themselves any privilege
- Bypasses entire approval workflow
- No audit trail of actual authorization decisions

**Recommendation**:
- Remove all mock token generation code
- Implement proper broker integration with OIDC/SAML
- Require external authentication server

### 3. Storage Encryption Not Implemented (CVSS 7.2)
**Location**: `jitd/src/storage.rs:95-105`
```rust
fn encrypt_grant(&self, grant: &JitGrant) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    // TODO: Implement proper encryption using host key + TPM
    // For now, just serialize as JSON
    let json = serde_json::to_vec(grant)?;
    Ok(json)
}
```
**Impact**:
- Grants stored in plaintext on disk
- Privilege information readable by any process with file access
- No protection against offline attacks

**Recommendation**:
- Implement AES-256-GCM encryption
- Use TPM-sealed encryption keys
- Add key derivation from host identity

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High-Risk Issues

### 4. Socket Permission Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.8)
**Current State**: Socket owned by unprivileged user `azureuser:azureuser`
```bash
srwx------  1 azureuser azureuser   0 jitd.sock
```
**Impact**:
- Sudo plugin (running as root) cannot communicate with daemon
- Potential privilege escalation if socket permissions changed
- Service unavailable in production deployment

**Recommendation**:
- Run daemon as root with dropped privileges after socket creation
- Set socket permissions to `0660 root:sudo`
- Implement socket activation via systemd

### 5. Insufficient Input Validation (CVSS 6.8)
**Location**: Command pattern matching throughout codebase
```rust
grant.claimset.cmnd_patterns.iter().any(|pattern| {
    if pattern.ends_with('*') {
        let prefix = &pattern[..pattern.len() - 1];
        full_command.starts_with(prefix)
    } else {
        full_command == *pattern
    }
})
```
**Impact**:
- Potential command injection via crafted patterns
- Wildcard patterns may match unintended commands
- No sanitization of user inputs

**Recommendation**:
- Implement strict regex validation for patterns
- Escape all shell metacharacters
- Add command allowlist/blocklist functionality

## üîí Security Strengths

### ‚úÖ Memory Safety
- **Rust Implementation**: Prevents buffer overflows, use-after-free, and race conditions
- **C Plugin Safety**: Uses `strncat` with proper bounds checking
- **No Unsafe Code**: Core logic avoids unsafe Rust blocks

### ‚úÖ Systemd Security Hardening
Excellent security directives in `jitd.service`:
```ini
NoNewPrivileges=true
ProtectSystem=strict
ProtectHome=true
PrivateDevices=true
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true
RestrictRealtime=true
RestrictSUIDSGID=true
```

### ‚úÖ Fail-Safe Architecture
- **Deny by Default**: Plugin denies all access without valid grant
- **TTL Enforcement**: Automatic expiration prevents persistent access
- **Audit Trail**: Structured logging of all decisions

### ‚úÖ IPC Security
- **Unix Sockets**: Local communication only, no network exposure
- **Structured Protocol**: JSON-based IPC with proper error handling
- **Connection Isolation**: Each request handled in separate task

## üõ†Ô∏è Remediation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (1-3 days)

**Priority 1 - Address Critical Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Replace Hardcoded Keys**
```bash
# Generate production key pair
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out /etc/jit-sudo/private.key
openssl ec -in /etc/jit-sudo/private.key -pubout -out /etc/jit-sudo/public.key
chmod 600 /etc/jit-sudo/private.key
```

2. **Remove Mock Authentication**
```rust
// Delete this entire function:
fn create_mock_token(...) -> Result<String> { ... }
```

3. **Fix Socket Permissions**
```rust
// In main.rs, after socket creation:
std::process::Command::new("chown")
    .args(&["root:sudo", socket_path])
    .status()?;
```

### Phase 2: Security Enhancements (1 week)

**Storage Encryption Implementation:**
```rust
use aes_gcm::{Aes256Gcm, Key, Nonce};
use rand::Rng;

impl Storage {
    fn encrypt_grant(&self, grant: &JitGrant) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
        let key = self.derive_encryption_key()?;
        let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(&key);
        let nonce = Aes256Gcm::generate_nonce(&mut OsRng);
        
        let plaintext = serde_json::to_vec(grant)?;
        let ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(&nonce, plaintext.as_slice())?;
        
        // Prepend nonce to ciphertext
        let mut encrypted = nonce.to_vec();
        encrypted.extend(ciphertext);
        Ok(encrypted)
    }
}
```

**Input Validation Framework:**
```rust
use regex::Regex;

pub struct CommandValidator {
    allowed_patterns: Vec<Regex>,
    blocked_commands: HashSet<String>,
}

impl CommandValidator {
    pub fn validate_command(&self, cmd: &str) -> Result<()> {
        // Check against blocklist
        if self.blocked_commands.contains(cmd) {
            return Err(JitError::CommandBlocked);
        }
        
        // Validate against patterns
        if !self.allowed_patterns.iter().any(|re| re.is_match(cmd)) {
            return Err(JitError::CommandNotAllowed);
        }
        
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (2-3 weeks)

**Advanced Security Features:**
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
- Integration with SIEM systems
- Compliance reporting (SOX, PCI, HIPAA)
- Session recording capabilities

## üéØ Conclusion

The JIT Sudo system represents an innovative approach to privilege management with solid architectural foundations. However, **it is currently NOT suitable for production deployment** due to critical security vulnerabilities, particularly the use of hardcoded cryptographic keys and mock authentication bypasses.

**With proper remediation, this system has the potential to be a robust, enterprise-grade security tool.** The underlying design principles are sound, the memory safety guarantees are strong, and the systemd hardening is exemplary.

### Recommended Actions:
1. **Immediate**: Address all critical vulnerabilities before any production consideration
2. **Short-term**: Implement comprehensive security enhancements
3. **Long-term**: Add advanced security features for enterprise deployment

### Time to Production Readiness:
- **With dedicated security team**: 2-3 months
- **With current development pace**: 6-12 months
- **Emergency deployment** (with risks): 2-4 weeks minimum

The security audit reveals both significant promise and serious concerns. Proper investment in security remediation will result in a valuable security tool; deployment without these fixes poses substantial risk to organizational security.
